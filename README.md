# moovihub2
Moovihub is an online platform developed by a team of two as an
end-of-year assignment, following an agile workflow. It provides
users with the ability to compile and evaluate the movies they
have watched. By incorporating basic machine learning elements,
the platform enhances movie recommendations based on users' watch
history and ratings. Additionally, users can access interactive
data visualization to gain insights into their viewing patterns.
The application offers the option to provide concise or detailed
feedback on movies, enabling the machine learning algorithm to
utilize valuable and meaningful information in order to optimize
its recommendations. To enrich the movie data, Moovihub integrates
the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, allowing users to access
comprehensive information about movies, including details such as
cast, genres, and release dates. This integration further enhances
the movie-watching experience for users and provides them with a
comprehensive source of movie data.
